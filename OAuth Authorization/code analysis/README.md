## The analysis results for each code file regarding these misuses of OAuth for authorization:

# 1) Local storage of relying party secrets (e.g.,  bundling secrets as field variables, resource files, or constants in code)
   Although RP secrets are intended to be used by SPs to authenticate the RP, many developers store these secrets on the client-side application, posing a significant security threat to the user’s privacy. As a result, an attacker could retrieve the secret through reverse engineering, and use it to impersonate a benign application and request an access token from the SPs.
3) Local storage of access tokens (e.g., storing in filesystem): The storage of access tokens is a critical security concern as they provide RPs access to a user’s protected resources hosted by SP. Simply storing them on client devices can easily compromise user accounts. Attackers may steal locally-stored tokens, consequently gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information stored in SPs.
4) Inadequate transmission protection (e.g., transmitting security-sensitive information in plaintext): OAuth security heavily depends on the secure transmission of messages during the OAuth process. Transmitting messages in plaintext lets attackers eavesdrop and steal access tokens or other OAuth credentials. It is crucial to use SSL/TLS encryption when transmitting confidential information during OAuth transactions to prevent this exploit.
5) Lack or misuse of the state parameter (e.g., constant values for state): The state parameter safeguards user sessions against a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by verifying request authenticity. In CSRF an attacker uses a user’s previous session data to make a malicious request on their behalf. OAuth guidelines recommend generating and validating a randomized state parameter, bound to the user’s session to prevent such attacks [22]. However, developers may misunderstand its purpose leading to mistakes such as using a predictable or constant value, enabling multiple replays, neglecting state parameter verification, accepting requests without a state parameter, or assuming that all state parameters generated by their app are valid without proper session binding checking [S51]
6) Client-side API call (Client devices should not be trusted during API calls that are involved in the flows for OAuth authentication. ): A significant security concern in OAuth authentication flows arises from the reliance on clientside API calls, which attackers could easily manipulate. Some developers mistakenly assume that access tokens granted by SPs are only valid for their application. However, an attacker can use an access token granted for a malicious application to log in as a user for a different, benign application and gain access to sensitive information.
7) Insecure redirection options (such as WebView in Android)
8) Lack of authentication (The application doesn't authenticate the service provider)
9) Lack of PKCE parameters for authorization code grant
10) Insecure grant types
