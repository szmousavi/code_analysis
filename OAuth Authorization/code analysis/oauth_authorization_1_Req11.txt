1) Yes, this code has local storage of relying party secrets. The client secret is stored locally and loaded through `FileInputStream(CLIENT_SECRET_DIR)`.

2) Yes, access tokens are stored locally in the filesystem. This is shown in the `setDataStoreFactory(new FileDataStoreFactory(new File(TOKENS_DIRECTORY_PATH)))` line of code.

3) No, there is no evidence of inadequate transmission protection in this provided code. It uses HTTPS for communication which by default enforces encryption for data transmission.

4) No, this code doesn't seem to misuse the state parameter for OAuth2.0; in fact, it does not reference the state parameter at all.

5) No, there are no client-side API calls in this code. The code uses server-side operations for OAuth 2.0.

6) No, there are no insecure redirection options used, such as WebView in Android, shown in this code.

7) No, there is no lack of authentication in this code. The code uses Google's OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

8) Yes, the code lacks PKCE parameters for authorization code grant. There's no code for generating or verifying a code challenge and verifier which are required aspects of PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).

9) No, this code uses authorization code grant which is a secure grant type. There's no evidence of using insecure grant types like implicit.
