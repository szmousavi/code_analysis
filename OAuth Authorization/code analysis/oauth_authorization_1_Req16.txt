1) Yes, there is local storage of relying party secrets. In the code, the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET variables are used to store secrets.

2) Yes, local storage of access tokens is present in the code. The tokens are stored in a local file directory specified by TOKENS_DIRECTORY_PATH variable.

3) No, there is no inadequate transmission protection. Google APIs use HTTPS for data transmission, which is secure.

4) Yes, there is misuse of the state parameter. The state parameter isn't used at all.

5) Yes, there is a client-side API call. The GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder is making calls to the authorization server from the client.

6) Unable to determine if there are insecure redirection options as we are not seeing any WebViews or similar components being used in the code.

7) No, the program authenticates the service provider. The GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder class handles this.

8) Yes, there is a lack of PKCE parameters for authorization code grant. The code doesn't seem to be using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) flow which adds an additional layer of security.

9) No, there are no insecure grant types used in the code. The code is using the Authorization Code Grant workflow which is secure. However, keep in mind that the exact determination of security can depend on how certain things are implemented which might not be visible from this code snippet.
