1) Yes, the code is loading client secrets from a stored file using the GoogleClientSecrets.load() function. This falls under local storage of relying party secrets.
2) Yes, the access token would be stored on the filesystem by Google's client library during authorization in the provided DATA_STORE_DIR directory. 
3) No, the code is not transmitting security-sensitive information in plaintext. It uses GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport(), which provides HTTPS encryption.
4) Not Applicable, as the code does not involve state parameter.
5) Yes, the client-side API calls could be a vulnerability. The client device is involved when the code runs GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow and AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp.
6) No, there is no evidence of insecure redirection options in the code.
7) No, the code includes an authentication process via Google Authorization with the help of client secrets and OAuth 2.0
8) Yes, the code lacks Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) parameters for the authorization code grant which makes it vulnerable to authorization code interception attacks.
9) Not Applicable, insecure grant types are not identifiable in the given code snippet.
