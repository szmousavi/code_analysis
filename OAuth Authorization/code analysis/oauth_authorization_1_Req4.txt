1) Yes, there's local storage of relying party secrets. The code loads client secrets from a local file `client_secret.json`.
2) Yes, there's local storage of access tokens. Credential objects stored by the `FileDataStoreFactory` in the `DATA_STORE_DIR` include access tokens.
3) No, there's no inadequate transmission protection. The code uses GoogleNetHttpTransport which uses HTTPS for communication.
4) Not Applicable - Without more context on how the state parameter should be used in this specific case, it's hard to say definitively.
5) Not Applicable - Without more context on the usage of this code, it's hard to say if it is used for client-side API calls.
6) Not Applicable - The code doesn't appear to use any redirect options.
7) Not Applicable - The application appears to authenticate the service provider (Google), as OAuth 2.0 authorization protocols are used.
8) Not Applicable - PKCE parameter is not required for installed apps, which is the type indicated by the flow in this code (`AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp`).
9) No, there aren't any insecure grant types as the application only uses Authorization Code Grant which is secure if used properly.
