1) Yes, local storage of relying party secrets is happening in the CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH ("/credentials.json") which is loaded into GoogleClientSecrets object. This could potentially expose sensitive data such as Client ID, Client Secret in case of a system compromise.

2) Yes, local storage of access tokens happens here. The access tokens are stored in the "tokens" directory in the file system, as indicated by TOKENS_DIRECTORY_PATH constant and usage of FileDataStoreFactory class.

3) No, inadequate transmission protection vulnerability is not directly spotted in the provided code, however, it's worth noting that all HTTP transmission security would be handled by the libraries and configuration used, which are not shown in this extract.

4) Yes, there is a lack/misuse of the state parameter in the code. There doesn't appear to be usage of the state parameter, which aids in mitigating CSRF attacks at all.

5) Yes, this is a client-side API call since all operations are being done directly in client's environment using Google's libraries and executing these calls directly from client's machine.

6) No, there is no insecure redirection options such as WebView being used in Android in the provided snippet. 

7) No, lack of authentication is not a vulnerability here. The application does authenticate the service provider through OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant. The presence of the GoogleClientSecrets and GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow objects shows that the application does proper authentication.

8) Yes, there is a lack of PKCE parameters for authorization code grant. PKCE is a security extension to OAuth 2.0 for public clients on mobile devices, designed to prevent interception of the authorization code by a malicious application.

9) No, insecure grant types is not a vulnerability here. The application only utilizes the authorization code grant type, which is considered to be one of the more secure grant types if implemented properly. However, it does lack PKCE parameters which should be included for enhanced security.
